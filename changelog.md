# Changelog

## v2.13.0: Make it typed!

1. Added pydantic-based config class and built-in default values and validation logic
2. Added support to disabling captcha by using `captcha.provider=None`
3. Modified config structure for better clarity

This update implies that the drivers hub configuration is now strongly typed, and will be formally verified when loaded or updated.

## v2.12.1

1. Improved Discord API response handling
2. Replaced `json.loads(r.text)` with `r.json()` for more idiomatic json response handler
3. Optimized statistics handling with `cysimdjson`
4. Extended database connection timeout on tracker webhook update endpoints

## v2.12.0

0. Renamed release file `main` to `drivershub`; Removed `launcher`
1. Optimized app startup
   - Moved database initialization logic to `main setup init-db` command
   - This avoids unnecessary database queries on each startup
2. Added `timeout_worker_healthcheck=120` in `uvicorn.run` config
   - This should prevent "child process died" issue on low-spec servers
3. Replaced `parent` with `master` in command line arguments
   - `master` refers to the main controller in multihub
   - This ensures consistency with `master-db` related arguments
   - This also removes the confusion with "parent server process"
4. Migrated `master-db` related command line arguments to environment variables
   - `MASTER_DB_HOST`, `MASTER_DB_USER`, `MASTER_DB_PASSWORD`, `MASTER_DB_POOLSIZE`
   - This would prevent leaking credentials through process list
5. Refactored prefixed redis implementation for more elegant approach
6. Refactored tracker data handling to use a centralized function
7. Fixed wrong string table key in **PATCH** `/user/profile` response
8. Fixed naive datetime that depends on system timezone
   - Added explicit `utc` timezone
9. Removed protection on `config.trackers` secrets in **GET**|**PATCH** `/config` for admin
   - This allows original secrets to be viewed and reused
   - This allows empty values to be written even without `unsafe=True`
   - The risk is deemed to be minimal and the benefit on convenience is justified

## v2.11.1

1. Fixed **GET** `/economy/merch/list` Unprocessable Entity error
2. Added `config.db_port` to allow non-default database port
3. Renamed `sync_to_x` parameters to `sync_from_x` in **PATCH** `/user/profile`
4. Fixed `config.economy.enable_balance_leaderboard` not being respected

## v2.11.0

1. Added support for UniTracker
   - Telemetry data is included
   - Job data highly overlaps with TrackSim's data
2. Ensured cursors are closed when database connection is released
   - This should prevent the rare issue of cursor datatype misalignment
   - Aggressive database connection cleanup is also removed
3. Replaced `pytz` with `zoneinfo` and `pycountry`
   - This enables fallback support for deprecated timezones
4. Miscellaneous improvements
   - Added `plugins` attribute to `/config` endpoint
   - Added `app.config_dict` attribute to avoid `app.config.__dict__`
   - Added conversion to `int` for `company_id` attribute in `config.trackers`
   - Added `police` data for jobs tracked with Trucky
   - Updated comment in external plugin example
   - Removed unused `config.frontend_urls.discord_callback` attribute

## v2.10.8

1. Improved database connection pool management
   - Increased `lock_wait_timeout` and added `wait_timeout`
   - Improved `refresh_conn` to timeout on stuck connection acquiring
     - An error will be raised if the connection cannot be refreshed
   - Added warning when cleanup function releases a connection
     - This indicates a programming error where a connection is not properly released
2. Fixed various background functions that do not release database connections properly
3. Added `after` and `before` params to **GET** `/user/notification/list`
4. Added a 1-second timeout to all middlewares registered by external plugins

## v2.10.7

1. Optimized **GET** `/dlog/statistics/chart`
2. Added `distance` column to `division` table for more efficient data access
3. Optimized division point calculation
4. Optimized **GET** `/dlog/leaderboard`
5. Optimized **GET** `/member/list`, `/user/list`, `/user/ban/list`

## v2.10.6

1. Added `attended` attribute in **GET** `/events/list`
2. Added application statistics endpoint **GET** `/applications/statistics`
3. Added response time tracker and degraded performance alert

## v2.10.5

1. Fixed email encoding issue with certain mail clients
2. Optimized delivery export feature for fast full-database export
   - Also, split `tollgate`, `ferry`, `train`, `total` expense into separate columns
3. Switched to `zstd` for data compression and decompression
4. Switched to `cysimdjson` for json parsing in dlog export for 10x faster performance

## v2.10.4

1. Improved Discord API error handling
2. Added support to German and Spanish banner rendering
3. Updated Portuguese string table

## v2.10.3

1. Fixed issues with database connection pool management

4. Added error in audit log on Discord API 400 Response

## v2.10.2

1. Minor bug fixes
2. Adjusted rate limit
3. Added support to centralized database connection pool
   - Use single connection pool for all hubs running under a single service
   - Enable this feature by toggling on the option `--use-master-db-pool`
   - `--master-db-host`, `--master-db-user`, `--master-db-password`, `--master-db-pool-size` must be provided as well
4. Added `dlog_meta` table for **GET** `/dlog/list` to reduce database delay
5. Added automatic discord role removal on member leave
6. Added support to modifying join timestamp
7. Fixed issue of cache not being refreshed when it is constantly being hit

## v2.10.1

1. Respect launch params when setting host, port and workers
2. Switched to use https protocol for steam api requests
3. Added `last_seen_before` param to **GET** `/member/list`
4. Moved **GET** `/divisions` to **GET** `/divisions/statistics`
5. Added **GET** `/divisions/{divisionid}/activity` for per-user statistics

## v2.10.0

1. Added task plugin
2. Added cancel user deletion request audit log
3. Fixed boolean data in dlog export

## v2.9.5

1. Improved banner generator:
   - Ability to choose whether to show division or rank as front row in the right side.
   - Accept custom background image defined by `banner_background_url` in config.
   - Accept custom background opacity defined by `banner_background_opacity` in config.

2. Added daily bonus reminder notification:
   - User may choose any time in the day to receive the notification.
   - Added **PATCH** `/member/bonus/notification/settings` to update notification settings.
   - Added **GET** `/member/bonus/notification/settings` to fetch notification settings.

3. Added support to modifying request object through middleware
   - Modified standard return value of `request` middleware: Originally only an optional `response` is returned. Currently either `None` or a tuple of `(request, response)` has to be returned. If `response` is not `None`, then the `response` will be returned directly. Otherwise, the request will be processed normally.

4. Added `discord_request` middleware to manipulate data sent to Discord
   - The  `method`, `url` and `data` in requests will be passed to `discord_message` middleware, and the middleware must return a valid `data` which will be sent to Discord.
   - If there are multiple middlewares present, the `data` will be updated by earlier ones in the list, and the updated data will be passed to later ones.
   - The middleware function must be synchronous and asynchronous functions will be not executed.

## v2.9.4

1. Fixed data inconsistency due to outdated transactions, see details below:  
   Since we use connection pools, connections are not newly created and re-used. Thus, there may be a transaction opened previously when a connection is acquired. Due to database transaction isolation level set to `READ REPEATABLE`, updates made after the transaction was opened are not reflected in the transaction. As a solution, we would run `ROLLBACK` and `BEGIN` on all newly acquired connections, to ensure that the previous transaction is closed and a new transaction is started.  
   Credit: Thanks to @dowmeister for helping with this issue.
2. Improved sub-application startup and shutdown event (aka, lifespan) handling, see details below:  
   Due to FastAPI/Starlette not supporting lifespan events in sub-applications, we previously called startup event with middleware when the first request is sent in, which potentially leads to database connection timeout due to lack of available connections in connection pool. To solve this issue, we are now calling startup event for sub-applications one by one from main application lifespan event. In addition, the function to close database connection pool on shutdown is added, so the database could be shutdown more gracefully.
3. Added retries and supported optional increased timeout for database connection acquisition, see details below:
   To further reduce the possibility of `Timeout` errors, we added retries on connection acquisition. Also, considering that we attempt to acquire a number of connections on startup and this may lead to lack of available connections, the timeout on connection acquisition for functions executed in startup event is increased to 10 seconds.
4. Added `division.status` in **GET** `/dlog/list`, made division status public to all users in **GET** `/dlog/{logid}/division`
5. Added `dlog` in **GET** `/challenge/{challengeid}` for a list of dlog ids

## v2.9.3

Updated dependencies:

- fastapi 0.100.0 => 0.110.2
- uvicorn 0.23.1 => 0.29.0
- aiohttp 3.8.5 => 3.9.5

- pydantic 2.1.1 => 2.7.0

## v2.9.2

1. Added `distance_note` and `bonus_note` to **PATCH** `/member/points`  
   Both `note` would be stored in `database`, `distance_note` in JSON in `data` column for `dlog` table and `bonus_note` in `note` column of `bonus_point` table  
   Both `note` would also be stored in audit log
   Additionally, `staff_userid` would be stored along with `distance_note` in `data` column for `dlog` table
2. Updated **GET** `/member/bonus/history`  
   Added `type` param which could be `daily` (default) or `all`.  
   When `type = daily`, all bonus history would be returned, including manually added ones and daily/distance bonus.
3. Updated **GET** `/dlog/list`  
   Added `manual: bool` param (default: `False`) which controls whether manually added distance is returned or tracked distance is returned.
   When `manual = true`, all manually added distance, along with the staff user and note would be returned.
4. Fixed wrong key ordering in user object due to redis caching

## v2.9.1

1. Added audit log category attribute  
   Available categories: `announcement`, `application`, `auth`, `challenge`, `division`, `dlog`, `downloads`, `economy`, `event`, `member`, `poll`, `system`, `tracker`, `user`  
   Additionally, `legacy` category is used for all audit log generated before `v2.9.1` ; `discord` category is used for Discord-related logs.  
2. Added detailed challenge completion record  
   NOTE: `completed` object was changed to `record` in **GET** `/challenge/{challengeid}`; `completed` (count) attribute was changed to `completed_user_count` in **GET** `/challenge/list`.
3. Added driver role validation when accepting jobs from webhook
4. Fixed error when webhook signature does not exist
5. Fixed error when adding a driver from Trucky webhook when the user exists in the database but does not have driver role

## v2.9.0

In this update, cache and other temporary data are moved to (in-memory) redis, which prolonged cache life, reduced database operations and allowed expiry refresh when the same resource is accessed. Also, it supported making updates to relevant data directly rather than waiting for cache to expire.  

All cache are set to expire after 60 seconds when the same resource is not accessed again, except `uactivity`, `alluserids` and `nlb` that expires 60 seconds after creation regardless of how many times it is accessed.

1. Switched `app.state.cache_session(_extended)` to redis `auth:{authorization_key}`.
2. Switched `app.state.cache_language/timezone/privacy/note` to redis `ulang:{uid}` / `utz:{uid}` / `uprivacy:{uid}` / `unote:{from_uid}/{to_uid}`
3. Added redis `umap:userid/discordid={id}` to link `userid` and `discordid` to `uid`
4. Switched `app.state.cache_userinfo/activity` to redis `uinfo:{uid}` / `uactivity:{uid}`
5. Simplified ratelimit handling by switching to redis, and removed the necessity of database operations
6. Added delay on request handling when multiple requests on the same route are received at the same time
7. Switched `app.state.cache_statistics` to redis `stats:{id}` and improved query algorithm
8. Switched `app.state.cache_leaderboard` and `cache_nleaderboard` to redis `lb` and `nlb` and improved query algorithm
9. Switched `app.state.cache_all_users` to redis `alluserids` and simplified cache expiry code
10. Switched `app.state.running_export` to redis `running_export` thus limited active dlog export process to one in all processes
11. Switched `app.state.session_errs` to redis `session_errs` thus prevented duplicate error webhook being sent (by multiple processes)
12. Switched from mysql database to redis for multiprocess handling
13. Added traceback handler for event and poll backgroud tasks

## v2.8.10

1. Improved param validation and added error response when `page`, `page_size`, `order`, `order_by` is invalid
2. Added support to custom tracker
   - `tracker.type`: `custom` | URL: `/custom-tracker/update`
   - `api_token` will not be used
   - Webhook signature header's key must be `signature`
   - Webhook data must follow TrackSim's format, otherwise may lead to `Internal Server Error`
   - `route` object may be included in `data.object`, which must follow the format of an array of objects containing `x`, `z`, `time` (`[{x: float, z: float, time: int}, {x: float, z: float, time: int}, ...]`)
   - `warp` value may be included in `data.object`, which must be an integer or a decimal
3. Added delayed cache clear to ensure async data consistency

## v2.8.9

1. Fixed Internal Server Error caused by email validating (`NoneType`)  
   - This includes: accepting a user / submitting an application when the user's email is not set
2. Fixed invalid email (`"None"`) being stored in database  
3. Made **PATCH** `/user/profile` to return updated user info as response (which also clears user info cache)
4. Added notification on ownership transfer for economy garage, garage slot, truck and merch

**Note**: This update will attempt to change all `"None"` (string) email in database to `NULL` (NULL)

## v2.8.8

1. Fixed issue updating multiple account connections at the same time
2. Renamed `config.smtp_passwd` to `config.smtp_password`
3. Renamed confusing `query` param key to more specific keys like (`name`, `reason`)
4. Added `?name` query param to **GET** `/user/ban/list`
5. Added add/remove driver from tracker company when staff update driver's steam connection
6. Improved `?order_by` handling
   - Improved second key
   - Renamed `user_id` to `userid` in **GET** `/member/list`

   - Added `garageid` to **GET** `/economy/garages/list`
   - Renamed `timestamp` to `create_timestamp` in **GET** `/events/list`
   - Hint: `timestamp` mostly refers to `timestamp` of resource creation

1. Reordered config keys
2. Fixed error loading languages files with `utf-8` encoding
3. Fixed error handling Trucky job with `refuel` event
4. Updated error message for `tracker.{api_token|webhook_secret}` to `trackers[{index}].{api_token|webhook_secret}`
5. Updated `ban_history` logic to create history record once ban is placed
6. Renamed values of `config.delivery_rules.action` for easier understanding:
   - `bypass` -> `keep_job`
   - `drop` -> `drop_data`
   - `block` -> `block_job`
7. Added auto-fill for missing attributes in `config.delivery_rules`
8. Removed application position handling - this should be done by frontend
9. Added country/region handling for local network
10. Renamed permissions
    - NOTE: Position-based permissions Human Resources Manager (`hrm`) and Human Resources (`hr`) have been removed. Roles with these permissions will be granted relevant function-based permissions automatically. This grant will be done in all future releases as long as `hrm` and `hr` permissions still exist in `config.perms`.

## v2.8.6

1. Fixed minor issue with dlog statistics
2. Added global MFA requirement to **POST** `/user/mfa/disable`
3. Added member role sync-to-discord feature
4. Improved string table
5. Improved config format

## v2.8.5

1. Added **POST** `/status/database/restart` to manually restart database pool
   - There is no access control for this endpoint because access control will not work when database is down.
   - Database must be unavailable when requesting database pool restart.
   - Automatic restart should usually work and this function is only a last solution.
2. Fixed issues related to `member role` handling
   - Updated **GET** `/member/banner` to use `order id` to order roles rather than using `role id`
   - Fixed **PATCH** `/member/roles` error when adding/removing an unknown role
3. Fixed Trucky job format conversion issues
   - Fixed error handling new jobs when `real_driven_distance_km = None`
4. Improved economy plugin
   - Fixed **GET** `/economy` leading to broken garages and trucks list
   - Fixed `GetTruckInfo` error when `vehicleid = None`
   - Fixed 422 errors when calling truck-related endpoints
   - Fixed incorrect damage data being used (`total_damage`, should be `current_damage`)
   - Fixed `self` being used as default owner on **POST** `/truck/transfer`
   - Fixed purchasing merch does not correctly deduct balance
   - Added `visibility` attribute to result of **GET** `/economy/balance`
   - Added the `wear_ratio` calculation
   - Added **PATCH** `/balance/{userid}` to update balance without making transaction
   - Limited transaction economy date range to 90 days
   - Limited job income to `4294967296`
   - Included all types in transaction list & export

## v2.8.4

1. Fixed Trucky job format conversion issues  
2. Added `?bypass_tracker_check=true|false` to `/trucky/import`  
3. Fixed error loading poll list  
4. Added `voted=true|false` to `poll` and `poll.choices` in `/poll/lists` and `/poll/{pollid}`  
5. Improved Discord profile handling: try `global_name` before `username`  
6. Integrated Trucky `realistic_settings` with `delivery_rules` (`enabled_realistic_settings`) and `challenge` plugin (`required_realistic_settings` in job requirements)  
7. Fixed incorrect damage when tracker is Trucky  

## v2.8.3

1. Minor improvements on string table and `apidoc.json`  
2. Deduplicated roles and event attendees on update  
3. Prevented disabling password login when there is no other login method  
4. Fixed detailed statistics unable to continue automatically when a dlog is deleted  
5. Added MFA verification on user deletion (self-operation)  
6. Added audit log for updating global note  
7. Removed authorization requirement when using email confirmation link  
8. Added German translation  

## v2.8.2

1. Fixed Trucky webhook handling issues  
2. Fixed update-connection failure when the provided connections are unchanged  
3. Fixed incorrect `role_history` data being returned  
4. Updated update-connection logic
   - Non-member users with conflicting connections will no longer be deleted automatically.
   - It is required to delete connection-conflicting users manually to proceed.  
5. Updated delete-connection logic
   - Steam & TruckersMP connection will no longer be deleted by default.
   - It is no longer needed to dismiss a member before deleting connections.
   - It is allowed to delete a specific connection by providing it in `path`.  
   - The endpoint has been re-routed from **DELETE** `/user/{uid}/connections` to **DELETE** `/user/{uid}/connections/{connection}`. `{connection}` is a string whose value is among `email`, `discordid`, `steamid`, `truckersmpid`.
6. Added `?email` query param to **GET** `/user/profile`  
7. Added support to TrackSim-Trucky Hybrid Tracker  
   - Definition of "default tracker": `config.tracker` if config has not been updated to the new format, or `config.tracker[0].type` if config has been updated to the new format.
   - The upgrader will set all user's tracker to the default tracker. The format of `config.tracker` will also be updated, which is a list containing multiple dictionaries, whose format looks like `{"type": str, "company_id": int, "api_token": str, "webhook_secret": str, "ip_whitelist": list}`.
   - On **POST** `/user/{uid}/accept`, `tracker` should be provided to set the tracker the user will be using. Otherwise, the default tracker will be used.
   - A new endpoint **POST** `/user/tracker/switch` has been created to allow user or staff to change the user's tracker. `update_member_roles` permission is required to update the tracker for another user.
   - `tracker` attribute has been added to `user` object.
   - When a driver is to be added to the tracker company, the driver will be added to all tracker companies no matter which tracker they choose to use. This is to prevent additional work to be done when the driver changes the tracker in the future.
   - When a driver submits a job, `tracker_in_use` will be checked to ensure that the data is coming from the correct tracker to prevent duplicate jobs.
   - Theoretically, there is no hard limit on the number of trackers, even if they are of the same `type`. But adding too many trackers may lead to downgraded performance on relevant functions, including adding/removing drivers to/from the tracker company. Though measures have been taken to prevent duplicate jobs from the same tracker being logged when multiple webhooks are sent at the same time (there is lag on database and multiple webhooks coming in at the same time may cause inability to detect duplicate jobs), we cannot promise that no duplicate jobs from the same tracker will be logged.
   - Hence, considering that we currently support TrackSim and Trucky as tracker, it's recommended to configure up to `2` trackers, one of TrackSim and one of Trucky.

## v2.8.1

1. Added **POST** `/trucky/import/{jobid}` to import jobs from Trucky  
2. Added `user_joined_company` Trucky webhook event listening  
3. Fixed the issue that empty email may lead to wrong ban check  

## v2.8.0

1. Removed `company_driver.detached` tracksim event listening  
2. Added "update discord email" when user reconnects discord account and email is not connected  
3. Added `config.discord_guild_message_replace_rules` for manipulating discord message content before sending  
    Config format: `{regex_match_rule_1(str): regex_replace_rule_1(str), ..., regex_match_rule_n(str): regex_replace_rule_n(str)}`
4. Added distance-based division points  
    Config format: `{"id": int, "name": str, "role_id": int, "points": {"mode": str("static"|"ratio"), "value": int|float}}`  
    When `mode` is `static`, each validated division delivery gets static points.  
    When `mode` is `ratio`, each validated division delivery gets `distance * value` points.  
    **Note**: Points of previously validated division deliveries will be updated when config is updated.  
5. Added support to multiple rankings  
    **Hint**: This function mainly focuses on providing multiple rank roles.  
    Config format: `[{"id": int, "name": str, "default": bool, "point_types": list: ["distance", "challenge", "division", "event", "bonus"], "details": ...original_ranks}]`  
    At least one item must have `default = true`, otherwise the first one will be considered `default`. The `default` ranking will be used for `daily_bonus` and `distance_bonus`. Specific `rank_type_id` will only be considered when user is requesting discord role for a specific rank type.  
    `point_types` must be a list with `str` items selected from `["distance", "challenge", "division", "event", "bonus"]`.

    Added `?connect_account` request param to `/auth/discord/redirect` to return dynamic oauth url  
    Added route `/auth/discord/connect` which redirects to frontend (`config.discord_callback`) with access code  
    Added route **PATCH** `/user/discord` which takes the access code in JSON and updates Discord account  
**Note** `/auth/discord/connect` needs to be added to `redirect uri` of Discord application besides `/auth/discord/callback` to make it work  
3. Added `config.register_methods[]` to restrict registration methods, accept `email`, `discord`, `steam`

## v2.1.0
  
**Breaking changes** ⚠️  
**Note: This is a release focusing on updating the user system, to allow every user to have a uid and use uid to identify users, rather than using discordid.**  
**Warning⚠️:** Major database structure updates involved, **backup** the database before upgrading to this version.  
**Hint:** It's no longer necessary to place an `upgrade.py` in the directory to upgrade, the upgrader is coded into the main program, which will be executed automatically.  

- Database Changes

1. Reordered columns in `user` table, added `uid` before `userid`. `uid` will be assigned to everyone with an `AUTO INCREMENT` property, `userid` will only be given to accepted members  
2. Swapped order of `update_staff_timestamp` and `update_staff_userid` in `application` table  
3. Changed tables using `discordid` to identify users to use `uid`.  
**Affected Tables:** `user_password`, `user_activity`, `user_notification`, `banned` (it's complex), `application`, `session`, `auth_ticket`, `application_token`, `settings`  
4. Changed `auditlog` using `userid` to identify users to use `uid`  
5. Renamed `temp_identity_proof` to `auth_ticket`.  
6. Changed `steamid,truckersmpid=-1/0` to `NULL`  
7. Added `AUTO_INCREMENT` property to `user.userid`, `user_notification.notificationid`, `dlog.logid`, `announcement.announcementid`, `application.applicationid`, `challenge.challengeid`, `downloads.downloadsid`, `event.eventid`, thus removed `nxtuserid`, `nxtnotificationid`, `nxtlogid`, `nxtappid`, `nxtannid`, `nxtchallengeid`, `nxtdownloadsid`, `nxteventid` in settings  

- API Changes

1. Added `?uid` query param to **GET** `/member/banner`, **GET** `/user`, **PATCH** `/user/profile`  
2. Added `uid` to `order_by` of **GET** `/user/list`, **GET** `/member/list`  
3. Changed `?discordid` query param to `?uid` for **DELETE** `/user/mfa`, **DELETE** `/user`  
4. Changed `discordid` in json data of **PUT** `/member`, **PUT**/**DELETE** `/user/ban`, **DELETE** `/user/connections` to `uid`  
5. Moved `?userid` query param of `/member/dismiss` to path (`/member/dismiss/{userid}`)  
6. Moved `uid` in json data to query param for **DELETE** `/user/connections`  
7. Renamed `/user/tip` to `/auth/ticket`

## v2.0.1 (pre-release)
  
1. Fixed user activity caching issue  
2. Added user language cache  

## v2.0.0 (pre-release)
  
**Breaking changes** ⚠️  
**Note: This is a pre-release focusing on request and response formats, major functionalities are not modified, there will be updates on the user system in v2.1.0.**  

1. Changed request data from `form` to `json` to better format complex data  
**Note** Form data will be rejected. You must add header `Content-Type: application/json`.  
**Hint** The data format for endpoints won't be affected, but some containing complex data will be modified, as shown in the table below.  
|Route|Affected Fields (Hint: `object` is `json`)|
--|--|
|**PATCH** `/config`|`config` (`string`     `object`)|
|**POST** `/application`|`data`->`application` (`string`     `object`)|
|**POST** `/challenge`|`job_requirements` (`string`     `object`), `required_roles` (`string`     `object` (`list`))|
|**PATCH** `/challenge/{challengeid}`|`job_requirements` (`string`     `object`), `required_roles` (`string`     `object` (`list`))|
|**PATCH** `/event/{eventid}/attendees`|`attendees` (`string`     `object` (`list`))|

2. Changed response format  
i) Removed `error: bool` field. Error status will only be reflected in **status code** (non-2xx responses).  
ii) Removed `descriptor: string` field. Added `error: string` field to explain the error, same as the original `descriptor: string` field.  
iii) Moved data inside `response: object` out.  
iv) On success, the response will be `204 No Content` if no message or data is returned.  
v) Removed `string     integer` conversion for most integers, known large integers like `discordid` will still be converted to string.  
vi) Changed `"-1"` or `""` or `"N/A"` values to `None`  
**Note** If you are using `-1` as `None` in your requests, you must remove it or you'll get incorrect responses!  
**Examples:**  
i) Unauthorized Error  
**STATUS: 401** `{"error": "Unauthorized"}`  
~~**Old format** `{"error": true, "descriptor": "Unauthorized"}`~~  
ii) Get Info  
**STATUS: 200** `{"info": "Some info here"}`  
~~**Old format** `{"error": false, "response": {"info": "Some info here"}}`~~  
iii) Update Info (Without a message returned)  
**STATUS: 204**  
~~**Old format** `{"error": false}`~~  
iv) Update Info (With a message returned)  
**STATUS: 200** `{"message": "Updated"}`  
~~**Old format** `{"error": false, "response": {"message": "Updated"}}`~~  

3. Changed request params name / format  
|Route|Affected Params|  
--|--|
|**GET** `/dlog/statistics/chart`|`?end_time`     `?before`|  
|**GET**/**DELETE** `/dlog`|`?logid` moved to path (`/dlog/{logid}`)|
|**GET**/**PATCH**/**DELETE** `/announcement`|`?announcementid` moved to path (`/announcement/{announcementid}`)|
|**GET**/**PATCH**/**DELETE** `/application`|`(form)applicationid` moved to path (`/application/{applicationid}`)|
|**PATCH** `/application/status`|`(form)applicationid` moved to path (`/application/{applicationid}/status`)|
|**GET**/**PATCH**/**DELETE** `/challenge`|`?challengeid` moved to path (`/challenge/{challengeid}`)|
|**PUT**/**DELETE** `/challenge/delivery`|`?challengeid,(form)logid` moved to path (`/challenge/{challengeid}/delivery/{logid}`)|
|**GET**/**PATCH**/**DELETE** `/downloads`|`?downloadsid` moved to path (`/downloads/{downloadsid}`)|
|**GET**/**PATCH**/**DELETE** `/event`|`?eventid` moved to path (`/event/{eventid}`)|
|**PUT/DELETE** `/event/vote`|`?eventid` moved to path (`/event/{eventid}/vote`)|
|**PATCH** `/event/attendees`|`?eventid` moved to path (`/event/{eventid}/attendees`)|

4. Updated routes  
|Route|Remark|
--|--|
|**GET** `/member/list/all`|Removed|
|**GET** `/event/all`|Removed|
|**GET** `/division?logid`|Splitted to **GET** `/division` and **GET** `/dlog/{logid}/division`|

|**GET** `/downloads/{secret}`|Renamed to **GET** `/downloads/redirect/{secret}`|
|**PATCH** `/event/{eventid}/vote`|Splitted to **PUT**/**DELETE** `/event/{eventid}/vote`|
|**PATCH** `/event/{eventid}/attendee`|Renamed to **GET** `/event/{eventid}/attendees`|

5. Updated response/object format  
**Hint** These formats apply whenever the object is returned, which greatly improves the API's usability and could reduce the amount of requests.  
i) Activity `{status: str, last_seen: int}` or `None`  
ii) Ban `{reason: str, expire: int}` or `None`  
iii) User `{userid: int, name: str, email: str, discordid: str, steamid: str, truckersmpid: int, avatar: str, bio: str, roles: list, activity: dict, mfa: bool, join_timestamp: int}`  

6. Removed object wrapper including `user: {}`, `application: {}`, `dlog: {}`, `downloads: {}`, `event: {}`  
7. Replaced completed member list (`completed`) in `/challenge/list` with the number of completed members, the detailed list could be fetched with `/challenge/{challengeid}`  
8. Replaced voted member list (`votes`) and attendees (`attendees`) in `/event/list` with the number of voted members and attendees, the detailed list could be fetched with `/event/{eventid}`

**How to enable external innodb directory in MySQL?**  
(Suppose the directory is `/var/lib/mysqlext`)  

1. Create directory, change permission
   > chown mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysqlext

2. Open `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf` and add
   > innodb_directories = /var/lib/mysqlext/ # this adds the directory to known innodb directory
   > secure-file-priv = /var/lib/mysqlext/ # this allows non-root user to create table with DATA DIRECTORY

3. Grant `FILE` privilege to the database user (which does not seem to be included in `ALL` privileges).

4. Reload mysqld: `systemctl restart mysql`

5. Open `/etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld` and add
    > /var/lib/mysqlext/ r,
    > /var/lib/mysqlext/** rwk,

6. Reload apparmor: `service apparmor reload`
